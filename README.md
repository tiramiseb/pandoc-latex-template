# Alcyon

Some extension to the excellent [*Eisvogel* clean **pandoc LaTeX template** to convert your markdown files to PDF or LaTeX](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template). "Eisv√∂gel" in German can be translated to "Alcyon" in French, hence this page's title.

Please see [the original documentation](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template) for details about anything else than my additions.

I only maintain my minor extensions and I want to heavily rely on Wandmalfarbe's work. I unfortunately don't have time to make clean work about this. I prefer being honest about that. If however someone wants to take my quick'n'dirty modifications and improve them, feel free!

## Additions

The document's subject (as defined in the `subject` metadata) is placed on top of the title on the titlepage, and in the page header before the document's title. My aim for it is to be used as a project or customer name (or both :slightly_smiling_face:).

Enterprise-specific additions:

* table of revisions
* table of validations

## Additional specific configuration
